# DSMR-tester
Arduino Uno firmware to emulate the P1 telegram output of DSMR-compatible digital meters.

## Usage
Instructions below are for use with the [P1-dongle](https://github.com/plan-d-io/P1-dongle).
1. Compile the `DSMR-test.ino` code in the Arduino IDE and upload to the Uno at 115200bps
2. Connect the `GND` pins of the Arduino and the P1 dongle
3. Connect pin `3` of the Arduino to the `Rx` pin of the P1-dongle

>Optionally, you can also connect the 5V pins of the Arduino and the dongle to provide power to the dongle. **Do not do this if you are powering the dongle through USB.** 
>If you are powering the Arduino through USB, it's possible the Arduino will not be able to provide enough power for the dongle to work reliably. 

## Functionality
Every 2 seconds, the firmware will output a meter telegram based on the [eMUCs â€“ P1 V1.7.1 specification](https://maakjemeterslim.be/rails/active_storage/blobs/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBBZ0lEIiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--cdd9b48fd0838e89b177f03b745b23450fd8f53e/e-MUCS_P1_Ed_1_7_1.pdf?disposition=attachment) and the [DSMR 5.0.2 P1 Companion Standard](https://www.netbeheernederland.nl/_upload/Files/Slimme_meter_15_a727fce1f1.pdf). The values for actual power are randomised and the values for energy offtake increment continously, allowing end-to-end data pipeline verification. When the telegram is being sent, the Arduino LED will light up.

If using the P1-dongle, the dongle LED will stop flashing if the dongle has succesfully received and verified the meter telegram. See [Basic LED signals](https://github.com/plan-d-io/P1-dongle/wiki/Basic:-LED-signals).
